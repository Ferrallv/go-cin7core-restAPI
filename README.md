#go-cin7core-restAPI

This is a personal workthrough project to create a go module for working with the [cin7core api (formerly dear)](https://dearinventory.docs.apiary.io/).
This is far from finished code, it's messy and might be dropped or changed depending on my use cases. My hope is to have this a "complete" endeavor at some point.

In the mean time the purpose of the module being made public is for simpler access for another project.
